#Checkstyle Samples application

@author ShriKant

In this application a lot of custom Checkstyle rules have been created. For some, test conditions have been prepared. 
This document provides the details about them and also on how to run them.


##Build
-----
To build the application simply run build.bat on Windows platform or run build.sh on UNIX/LINUX platform.
You need to have ANT available to build the application. As part of build, it will create classes in bin directory 
and will create a Jar file inside target directory.

##Run the samples

Please note to run the below mentioned checks, please comment other Checks in the custom_check.xml and uncomment 
the one you want to execute.

###MethodCallWithoutObjectCreation Check
This Check provides the instances where a method has been called on an uninitialized variable.
To run the test condition use:
  run.bat samples\InterfaceServiceImpl.java

###MethodLimitCheck Check
This Check checks the number of methods inside a class. If it exceeds from a pre-determined number, it gives the error.
To run the test condition use:
  run.bat samples\Test.java

###TraceMessagesCheck Check
This Check checks if for a specific pattern of classes, trace messages for method enter and exit
are there or not.
To run the test condition use:
  run.bat samples\TraceEnterSample.java
  
###NoStateVariables Check
This Check validates if a pattern of classes contains state variables when those classes are supposed 
to be stateless.
To run the test condition use:
  run.bat samples\SingletonSample.java
  
###IllegalMethodCallInLoopCheck Check
This Check checks if a method call has been used in a loop condition.
To run the test condition use:
  run.bat samples\SingletonSample.java

##IllegalExceptionCatchCheck and IllegalExceptionThrowsCheck Check
These two checks focuses on catching instances where something illegal exception type is caught or thrown in methods.
To run the test conditions use:
  run.bat samples\Test.java
